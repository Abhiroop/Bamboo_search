(PTI Photo) RELATED Scorecard: Kolkata Knight Riders vs Delhi Daredevils KOLKATA: Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders got off to a winning start in IPL 6 with a six-wicket win over Delhi Daredevils at a packed Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Scorecard | Match in Pics The hosts did face a few hiccups as they chased a modest 129 for victory. But, in the end, they romped home comfortably, with six wickets and eight balls remaining. Captain Gautam Gambhir led the chase with a 29-ball 42 while Jacques Kallis (23), Manoj Tiwary (23) and Yusuf Pathan (18 not out) playing the supporting role. The win, though, was facilitated by last season's Man of the Tournament, Sunil Narine whose spell of 4-0-13-4 made sure Kolkata did not have to chase many. Gambhir had everything going his way --- he won the toss, put the rivals into bat and wrapped up their innings for 128 only. He then led from the front to steer his team to a position of strength as the DD bowling and fielding looked rusty. DD skipper Mahela Jayawardene hoped that the youngsters will come good in the absence of key players like Virender Sehwag and Mornie Morkel. But Unmukt Chand and Manprit Juneja failed to deliver as the onus fell on the skipper to put up a challenge before the Knights at a jam-packed Eden Gardens. KKR bowling mentor-cum-pacer Brett Lee straightaway set up the tone of the tournament by sending Chand's off-stump for a walk with the very first delivery of the evening. But Jayawardene and David Warner steadied the ship thanks to some wayward bowling by both Lee and Jacques Kallis. Gambhir then had to throw the ball to Narine to force a breakthrough and the mystery bowler responded immediately. The West Indian got his fifth ball to jump a bit more to have Warner edge it to the safe hands of Kallis at first slip. Juneja never looked comfortable in the middle and his frustration got the better of him when he tried to lift Balaji over the in-field only to be caught beautifully by a diving LR Shukla at deep point. Naman Ojha and Johan Botha also left in quick succession. The going was so smooth for KKR, that Gauti, who removed Narine from the attack after just one over, brought him back only in the 16th and the spinner claimed three more overs in his last three overs to finish off with four for 13, restricting Delhi to a modest total. Losing wickets at regular intervals prevented Jayawardene on the other end from breaking loose. The former Sri Lankan skipper had to stay in the middle and he resorted to those tiny nudges and tickles to keep the scoreboard moving. It was only after completing his 50 off 46 balls, that Jaywardene opened up and hit Lee for the first six of the match over mid-wicket and followed it up with a four through long-on. But he fell in the next ball in a rather soft way, being caught at cover by Narine off a full toss. But it was only because of his 52-ball 66 that DD were able to post something on the board.
